Module: CPP Parser
--------------------------------------------------------

* Implements module(s):
cpp_parser, cpp_parser_mt

* Primary maintainer:
Leroy Sikkes

* Contributors:
Daniel Wustenhoff

* Purpose:
Parses a (preprocessed) C++ file (header or source file), and extracts an AST for each file.

* Usage:
Either use cpp_parser (single-threaded) or cpp_parser_mt (multi-threaded), and all followed files will be processed by the c++ parser module. 
File extension is not significant, and is ignored.

* Documentation:
The MT variant is multi-threaded, and will be significantly faster on multi-core machines. 
However, parse order is not guaranteed, and the tree will be reordered semi-randomly.
(is actually ordered by the finishing time of parsing when multiple files are parsed concurrently)
Most of the testing occurs with the non MT variant, for ease of debugging, and consistency.
Code resides in cxxTokenizer and cxxAstParser.
